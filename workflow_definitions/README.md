# Workflow definitions

There are 3 workflow definitions:

- [adsorption.yaml](adsorption.yaml)
- [adsorption-diffusion.yaml](adsorption-diffusion.yaml)
- [diffusion.yaml](diffusion.yaml)

They all use the same common files:

- [hooks](../hooks/): Scripts that provide the logic for restart hooks of components
